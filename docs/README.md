The `@cloudflare/workspace` package provides an out of the box virtual filesystem for use in any Durable Object — it's persistent and backed by SQLite. It's primarily designed for agents that need small, portable filesystems and tools to work with.

![Architecture overview](./assets/arch.png)

It provides:

 - A fs API for working with files and directories compatible with Worker bindings.
 - R2-backed mounts for pre-filling read-only data into the workspace tree.
 - Durability over DO restarts for all file operations.
 - A pluggable shell backend: a Cloudflare Container running the `wsd` FUSE daemon (full Linux userland) or a Dynamic Worker running [just-bash](https://github.com/vercel-labs/just-bash) (no container, broad textual tooling).
 - Workspace constructable without a backend, for filesystem-only use cases.
 - Out-of-the-box tools for `@cloudflare/agents`. **(not yet implemented)**

It comes with the following limitations:

 - ~10GB maximum (it shares storage with the DO).
 - The container-side filesystem is held in memory, so very large trees aren't a fit. Aim for agent-scale workspaces, not full monorepos.
 - Container access goes through FUSE, so heavy IO workloads (large `node_modules` installs, big tarball extractions) take a measurable performance hit compared to a native filesystem.

## Installation

Install the package into your Worker/Agent project:

```sh
npm install @cloudflare/workspace
```

The package ships several entrypoints:

| Entrypoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `@cloudflare/workspace` | The Workspace facade, stub types, the R2 mount, and proxy classes. |
| `@cloudflare/workspace/backends/container` | `CloudflareContainerBackend` and `withWorkspaceContainer`. Pulls in the wsd / capnweb sync plumbing. |
| `@cloudflare/workspace/backends/worker` | `WorkerBackend` and the bundled just-bash shell. The shell ships as a record of code-split modules the Dynamic Worker loads on demand: a ~290 KB entry parsed on cold start, plus ~2.5 MB of chunks that stay cold until a script reaches for them. |
| `@cloudflare/workspace/git` | Isomorphic-git glue for working with checkouts inside the workspace. |
| `@cloudflare/workspace/artifacts` | `createArtifact`, a session-scoped facade over the Cloudflare Artifacts Workers binding, plus its argv CLI. |

A consumer that only uses the container backend never imports the
worker subpath, so the just-bash payload tree-shakes away.

Wire types shared with the in-container service live in the sibling package `@cloudflare/workspace-rpc` (subpaths `./server`, `./client`, `./driver`).

### Sandbox container image

The container needs the `wsd` daemon alongside a FUSE runtime. The recommended pattern mirrors [`examples/container/Dockerfile`](../examples/container/Dockerfile): build `wsd` as a single Node SEA binary (`npm run build:bin --workspace @cloudflare/workspace-wsd`), stage it into the image's build context, and copy it into a thin Debian base:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 debian:stable-slim

RUN apt-get update \
 && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
      fuse3 libfuse2t64 ca-certificates \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY build/wsd-linux-x64 /usr/local/bin/wsd
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/wsd

ENV PORT=8080
ENV MOUNT_POINT=/workspace
EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/wsd"]
```

`wsd`'s own default port is `45678`; the Cloudflare container backend pins the in-image listener to `8080`, which is what `examples/container/` uses. See [07. Injected Service](./07_injected_service.md) for the env vars (`PORT`, `MOUNT_POINT`, `FUSE_MOUNT`, `UPSTREAM_URL`, `EXEC_LOG_MAX_BYTES`) and the reverse-dial boot sequence.

## Example

```ts
import { AIChatAgent } from "@cloudflare/ai-chat";
import { Workspace } from "@cloudflare/workspace";
import { CloudflareContainerBackend } from "@cloudflare/workspace/backends/container";

export class Agent extends AIChatAgent<Env> {
	readonly workspace: Workspace;

	constructor(...args: ConstructorParameters<typeof AIChatAgent>) {
		super(...(args as [any, any]));
		this.workspace = new Workspace({
			storage:  this.ctx.storage, // DO storage → VFS lives here
			backends: [
				new CloudflareContainerBackend({
					container: () => this,
					workspace: { binding: "Agent", id: this.ctx.id.toString() },
				}),
			],
		});
	}

    onStart() {
		// Prime the backend connection in the background so the first
		// exec is warm. `ready()` is idempotent and lazy-connects over
		// the configured backends.
		this.ctx.waitUntil(
			(async () => {
				await this.workspace.ready();
				await this.workspace.fs.mkdir("/workspace", { recursive: true });
			})().catch(() => {}),
		);
    }
}
```

Once you have a `workspace` on your agent, the `fs` and `shell` surfaces feel a lot like Node's `fs/promises` and a shell session — everything is async, paths are absolute, and operations are durable across DO restarts.

Create and write files:

```ts
// Write a string (utf8 by default for strings).
await this.workspace.fs.writeFile("/workspace/notes/todo.md", "- [ ] ship it\n");

// Write binary content.
await this.workspace.fs.writeFile("/workspace/data/blob.bin", new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));

// Stream a large upload straight to disk.
await this.workspace.fs.writeFile("/workspace/uploads/big.csv", request.body!);
```

Read files back:

```ts
// As a string.
const todo = await this.workspace.fs.readFile("/workspace/notes/todo.md", "utf8");

// As a stream — handy for piping into a Response.
const stream = await this.workspace.fs.readFile("/workspace/uploads/big.csv");
return new Response(stream);
```

Create and walk directories:

```ts
await this.workspace.fs.mkdir("/workspace/notes/daily", { recursive: true });

for (const entry of await this.workspace.fs.readdir("/workspace/notes")) {
  console.log(entry.isDirectory ? `d ${entry.name}` : `f ${entry.name}`);
}
```

Remove files and directories:

```ts
await this.workspace.fs.rm("/workspace/notes/todo.md");
await this.workspace.fs.rm("/workspace/notes/daily", { recursive: true });
```

Search across the tree:

```ts
const hits = await this.workspace.fs.grep("TODO", "/workspace", { ignoreCase: true });
for (const hit of hits) {
  console.log(`${hit.path}:${hit.line}: ${hit.text}`);
}
```

Run a shell command in the sandbox — the same filesystem is mounted there, so writes from `fs` are immediately visible to `exec` and vice versa:

```ts
const run = await this.workspace.shell.exec("ls -la /workspace", { encoding: "utf8" });
const { stdout, exitCode } = await run.result();
console.log(stdout, exitCode);
```

`exec` returns a `ReadableStream` of events as well as the buffered `result()`. That makes it straightforward to forward live output to the browser as a Server-Sent Events stream — just transform each event into an SSE frame:

```ts
// Inside a fetch handler on your Agent.
async fetch(request: Request) {
  const run = await this.workspace.shell.exec("npm test", { encoding: "utf8" });

  const sse = run.pipeThrough(
    new TransformStream<
      | { id: string; seq: number; name: "stdout" | "stderr"; value: string }
      | { id: string; seq: number; name: "exit"; value: number },
      Uint8Array
    >({
      transform(event, controller) {
        // SSE frame: `event: <name>\ndata: <json>\n\n`
        const frame = `event: ${event.name}\ndata: ${JSON.stringify(event.value)}\n\n`;
        controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(frame));
      },
    }),
  );

  return new Response(sse, {
    headers: {
      "content-type":  "text/event-stream",
      "cache-control": "no-cache",
      "connection":    "keep-alive",
    },
  });
}
```

On the client:

```ts
const events = new EventSource("/agent/run");
events.addEventListener("stdout", (e) => console.log(JSON.parse(e.data)));
events.addEventListener("stderr", (e) => console.warn(JSON.parse(e.data)));
events.addEventListener("exit",   (e) => { console.log("exit", JSON.parse(e.data)); events.close(); });
```

  /** Subscribe to push-based file change events on the local store. See 04_filesystem_interface.md → Change events. */
  watchChanges(listener: ChangeListener, options?: SubscribeChangesOptions): () => void;
  /** Push pending DO-side writes to the configured backend. Resolves with the entry count. */
  push():  Promise<number>;
  /** Pull backend-side writes back into the DO. Resolves with { applied, skipped }. */
  pull():  Promise<ApplyResult>;
  /** Lazy-connect over the configured backends. Idempotent; safe to call from `onStart`. */
  ready(): Promise<void>;
  /** Wrap this Workspace in a stub for crossing the Workers RPC boundary. */
  stub():  WorkspaceStub;
  /** Tear down backend connections. */
